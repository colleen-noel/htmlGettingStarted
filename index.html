            <li>Milford, NH</li>

            <li>Windham, ME</li>
        </ul>

        I grew up in Milford, NH. My biggest move was out to Kalispell, MT when I was 24. I went to school there and
        began my career in the operating rrom. I now live in Windham ME, where I moved to for a job. This job has led me
        to realize that I want a bigger challenge and is allowing me the opportunity, financially, to take this course.

        <ol>
            <li>Reykjavik, Iceland</li>
            <li>Capri, Italy</li>
            <li>San Juan, Puerto Rico</li>
        </ol>
        All three places I'd like to visit for their beauty. I've been trying to plan a trip to Iceland for 2 years now,
        but things keep coming up. Capri looks beautiful in all the pictures I see of it. And I want to visit the
        Southern Caribbean, part of which is San Juan.

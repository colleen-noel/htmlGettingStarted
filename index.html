        <h3>Top 3 Cities I've Called Home</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Milford, NH</li><span>$ My family moved there when I was child to make a better life for us $</span>
            <li>Kalispell, MT</li><span>$ I moved out there with my then boyfriend to start a new life and figure out my
                next career move $</span>
            <li>Windham, ME</li><span>$ My husband and I moved to ME to be closer to his work, and I took a pay raise at
                a new hospital $</span>
        </ul>

        I grew up in Milford, NH. My biggest move was out to Kalispell, MT when I was 24. I went to school there and
        began my career in the operating room. I now live in Windham ME, where I moved to for a job. This job has led me
        to realize that I want a bigger challenge and is allowing me the opportunity, financially, to take this course.

        <h3>Top 3 Cities I'd Like to visit</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Reykjavik, Iceland</li>
            <li>Capri, Italy</li>
            <li>The Southern Caribbean</li>
        </ol>
        All three places I'd like to visit for their beauty. I've been trying to plan a trip to Iceland for 2 years now,
        but things keep coming up. Capri looks beautiful in all the pictures I have seen of it, and I'd love to visit
        Italy. Finally, I want to visit the islands in the Southern Caribbean, for their pituresque beaches and quaint
        towns.
